## Project Overview
#### Brief: RainforestRetail handles deliveries with a manual system, delivery routes are planned by hand, and there is a long wait for parcel deliveries.
---

The Pitstop Delivery Optimization System is a full-stack application that aims to allocate and optimize the route planning for warehouse drivers, ultimately increasing efficiency and automating the delivery process.

This project utilizes the Spring Boot framework for the backend and React for the frontend, providing a seamless and user-friendly experience.

## 7. Features

- **Route Optimization üöö :** The system calculates and suggests the most optimized routes for delivery drivers based on distance efficiency.

- **Direction Tracking ‚û°Ô∏è :** Drivers can see a list of displayed directions for their route with a marker that moves along the route depending on the step they select.

- **To Visit List üìù :** Two lists of 'To Visit' and 'Visited' addresses for driver ease.

- **Warehouse and Delivery Location Icons üè† :** For map simplicity, the warehouse can be easily identified compared to the delivery addresses.

- **Collected and Delivered Button ‚úÖ :** Drivers can keep up to date with their list of addresses to visit by marking the first checkpoint of the warehouse as collected and the following delivery addresses as delivered. A counter in the top corner will keep track of the deliveries made out of the total deliveries.

- **User-friendly Interface üíª :** The React frontend ensures a modern and intuitive user interface, enhancing the overall user experience for drivers on the go.

}
```

## 9. Use of External API 

[Route Planner API from Geoapify](https://apidocs.geoapify.com/docs/route-planner/#api)

Implemented an external API in our backend to optimize the route using Route Planner API. When a POST request is started, a new route will be created, and a request body is made using the DataLoader to send to the Geoapify API. Another function then handles the response from the API by converting from JSON to POJOs to save the relevant data to models using DTOs.

Use of an API key: To access an API key, sign up for a free account, which has a limit of 3,000 credits a day.
